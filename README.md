# Skin Cancer Classification using Ensemble Learning

This project aims to classify different types of skin lesions using an ensemble of pre-trained deep learning models. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the work [HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000) dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 10,015 images of various types of skin lesions.

## Models

These following pre-trained models are used in the ensemble:

1. GoogLeNet
2. ResNet-18
3. DenseNet-121
